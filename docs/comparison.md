## The Problem Every AI Builder Hits

You're building an AI agent. It's smart, fast, and helpful. But every time the session ends, it forgets everything. The user's preferences. Last week's decisions. The architecture you spent hours explaining. Gone.

So you search for "AI memory layer" and find yourself in a jungle of options, each claiming to be the best. Cloud-hosted platforms. Self-hosted libraries. Research prototypes. Single-binary tools. How do you choose?

This guide gives you a **practical evaluation framework**, not a brand shoot-out. We'll cover:

1. The **decision dimensions** that actually matter
2. A **capability matrix** you can fill in for any tool
3. How **Uteke** (our contribution) fits the landscape

---

## Uteke at a Glance

| Capability | Uteke | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Single Rust binary | `curl \| sh && done`. No Docker, Python, or database server. |
| **Data sovereignty** | Fully offline | Local ONNX embeddings (768d). Zero telemetry, zero network calls. |
| **Search** | Hybrid (Vector + FTS5 + RRF) | Finds by meaning AND exact keywords. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60) merges both. |
| **Recall speed** | ~45ms P50 at 10K memories | Local execution, no network round-trip. |
| **Multi-agent** | Rooms | Shared memory spaces with author attribution and cross-agent recall. |
| **Time-travel** | Native point-in-time | `uteke recall "deploy" --at 2025-01-15` — queries historical state. |
| **Extraction** | Offline (default) + LLM (optional) | Rule-based extraction works zero-config. Upgrade to LLM if desired. |
| **Integration** | MCP + CLI + HTTP API | JSON-RPC (stdio + HTTP), full CLI, REST API with view-only API keys. |
| **Dependencies** | Zero runtime deps | No Docker, Postgres, Neo4j, Python, or cloud account needed. |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | Truly open source. |

## The 7 Decision Dimensions

After analyzing the AI memory layer landscape, we identified seven dimensions that separate one tool from another. Every meaningful difference maps to one of these:

### 1. Architecture: Binary vs. Runtime Stack

| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Do I install one binary or a stack of services? | A single binary means `curl \| sh && done`. A runtime stack means Docker, Python, Postgres, Neo4j, and someone has to maintain it. |
| What's my failure surface? | Each dependency is a potential outage. Single binary = one moving part. Microservices = many. |

**Categories:**
- **Single binary**: Install in 10 seconds, zero runtime deps. Works on any OS.
- **Python library**: Needs Python runtime, venv management, package conflicts.
- **Docker stack**: Needs Docker, plus one or more databases (Postgres, Neo4j, Qdrant).
- **Cloud platform**: Needs network, account, API key. Data leaves your machine.

### 2. Data Sovereignty: Where Does Your Data Live?

| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Does my data ever leave my machine? | Healthcare, finance, legal, and enterprise users care deeply. "Cloud-optional" is not the same as "never leaves." |
| Are embeddings computed locally or sent to an API? | Even if you self-host, some tools send raw text to OpenAI for embedding generation. That's data leaving your machine. |

**Categories:**
- **Fully offline**: Local embeddings (ONNX, etc.), no network calls, no telemetry.
- **Self-hosted but cloud-dependent**: You run it, but it calls external LLM APIs for extraction/embedding.
- **Cloud-native**: Your data lives on someone else's server.

### 3. Search Quality: Keyword vs. Semantic vs. Hybrid

| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Can I find a memory by meaning, not just exact keywords? | Searching "deployment schedule" should find "we're rolling out Friday at 3pm." That requires semantic search. |
| Does it also support exact keyword matching? | Sometimes you need to find the exact term "Postgres-16.2", not a semantic approximation. |
| Are both combined? | Hybrid search (vector + FTS + fusion) gives the best of both worlds. Pure keyword search misses synonyms. Pure vector search misses exact terms. |

**Categories:**
- **FTS-only**: Keyword matching only. Fast but can't find meaning.
- **Vector-only**: Semantic matching only. Good for meaning, bad for exact terms.
- **Hybrid (Vector + FTS + RRF)**: The gold standard. Finds by meaning AND exact keywords, merged by Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

### 4. Multi-Agent Support: Solo vs. Collaborative

| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Can multiple agents share a memory space? | In production, you often have multiple agents working on the same project. If they can't share context, they duplicate work and miss each other's findings. |
| Is there author attribution? | When any agent can write to shared memory, you need to know who said what. |
| Can agents recall across each other's memories? | Some tools technically support multiple agents but isolate their namespaces. True multi-agent means cross-agent recall. |

**Categories:**
- **Single-player**: One agent, one namespace. No sharing.
- **Shared API**: Multiple agents access the same backend, but memories aren't attributed or grouped.
- **Rooms**: Shared memory spaces with author attribution, cross-agent recall, and contextual grouping.

### 5. Time-Travel: Can You Query the Past?

| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Can I recall what the memory store knew at a specific point in time? | "What did we know before the incident?" "When was this decision made?" Without time-travel, you can only see the current state. |
| Is it native or bolted on? | Native time-travel stores full history efficiently. Bolted-on solutions use changelogs or temporal extensions: more overhead, less reliable. |

### 6. Integration: How Does It Connect to Your Agent?

| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Does it speak MCP (Model Context Protocol)? | MCP is becoming the standard for AI agent tool integrations. Without it, you're writing custom glue code. |
| Is there an HTTP API? | For server-based or remote agents, you need HTTP access. |
| Is there a CLI? | For debugging, scripting, and ad-hoc queries, a CLI is essential. |

### 7. Total Cost of Ownership

| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| What's the setup cost? | "Free" tools that require Docker + Postgres + Neo4j have hidden operational costs. |
| What's the per-query cost? | Cloud LLM-based tools charge per extraction call. At scale, this adds up fast. |
| What's the maintenance cost? | Each dependency needs patching, updating, and monitoring. |

## The Capability Matrix

Fill in this matrix for any memory tool you evaluate. Here's how Uteke scores:

| Dimension | Uteke | What to look for in alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Single Rust binary (one `curl \| sh`) | Does it need Python? Docker? Postgres? Neo4j? Cloudflare Workers? |
| **Data sovereignty** | Fully offline. Local ONNX embeddings. Zero telemetry. | Does it call external APIs for embeddings/extraction? Does data leave your machine? |
| **Search** | Hybrid (Vector HNSW + FTS5 + RRF fusion) | Is it vector-only? FTS-only? Or hybrid? |
| **Recall speed** | ~45ms P50 at 10K memories | What's the latency? Is it network round-trip or local? |
| **Multi-agent** | Rooms: shared memory, author attribution, cross-agent recall | Can multiple agents share context? Is there author attribution? |
| **Time-travel** | Native point-in-time queries (`--at 2025-01-15`) | Can you query past states? Is it native or bolted on? |
| **Extraction** | Default: offline rule-based (zero API). Optional: LLM extraction. | Does it require an LLM API key to extract facts? Is there an offline option? |
| **Integration** | MCP server (stdio + HTTP), CLI, HTTP API | Does it speak MCP? Is there a CLI for debugging? |
| **Dependencies** | Zero runtime deps. No Docker, no Python, no database server. | Count the dependencies. Each one is operational overhead. |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | Is it truly open source or source-available? |

## The Four Archetypes

Most memory layers fall into one of four archetypes. Understanding which one you need narrows your choice quickly:

### Archetype 1: Cloud-Native Platform

- **Promise:** "We handle everything. Just send us your data."
- **Trade-off:** Data leaves your machine. Per-query costs. Network dependency.
- **Best for:** Teams with cloud-native stacks who don't have data sovereignty concerns.
- **Watch out for:** API costs at scale, vendor lock-in, data residency requirements.

### Archetype 2: Self-Hosted Infrastructure

- **Promise:** "Run it yourself with Docker."
- **Trade-off:** You're now a DevOps engineer. Postgres, Neo4j, Qdrant. Pick your poison.
- **Best for:** Teams with dedicated infra teams who want full control.
- **Watch out for:** Operational overhead. Each service is a maintenance burden and failure point.

### Archetype 3: Python Library

- **Promise:** "`pip install` and you're done."
- **Trade-off:** Python runtime management. Virtual environments. Package conflicts. Not suitable for production agents that need to be always-on.
- **Best for:** Prototyping, Jupyter notebooks, research.
- **Watch out for:** Deploying Python to production. GIL limitations. Dependency hell.

### Archetype 4: Single Binary

- **Promise:** "One binary. Zero deps. Works everywhere."
- **Trade-off:** Less ecosystem breadth. You're trusting one binary to do everything.
- **Best for:** Edge computing, privacy-sensitive domains, developers who value simplicity, agents that run on any machine without setup.
- **Watch out for:** Fewer pre-built integrations compared to ecosystem-heavy tools.

**Uteke is Archetype 4.** We made that choice deliberately. Every trade-off in Uteke's design (local ONNX embeddings, SQLite instead of Postgres, rule-based extraction as default) serves the goal of **zero operational overhead**.

## The Extraction Question

One of the most overlooked dimensions is **how memory tools extract facts from raw text**. Two approaches:

### LLM-Based Extraction (Common)

Most tools send your raw text to an LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic) to extract structured facts. This works well but:

- **Costs money** per call
- **Sends your data** to a third party
- **Requires an API key** before you can start
- **Adds latency** (network round-trip per extraction)

### Rule-Based Extraction (Uteke Default)

Uteke's default extraction mode uses a **zero-dependency offline extractor**: pattern matching, sentence boundary detection, keyword salience scoring, and deduplication. No API calls, no data leaving your machine, no configuration needed.

- **Works out of the box**: zero config, zero API keys
- **Completely private**: your text never leaves the machine
- **Multilingual**: handles Indonesian, emoji, UTF-8 properly
- **Optional LLM upgrade**: if you want richer extraction, switch to `mode = "llm"` and configure an API key

| Aspect | LLM-based (common) | Rule-based (Uteke default) |
|---|---|---|
| **API key required** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Data leaves machine** | ✅ Yes (sent to LLM) | ❌ Never |
| **Cost per call** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Free |
| **Setup** | Configure API key, model, endpoint | Works immediately |
| **Quality** | Richer, context-aware | Pattern-based, good for common fact types |
| **Multilingual** | Depends on LLM | ✅ UTF-8 safe (tested with Indonesian, emoji) |
| **Upgrade path** | — | `mode = "llm"` in config to enable LLM extraction |

This means you can start using Uteke immediately. Run `curl | sh`, store a memory, get facts extracted, all without signing up for anything.

---

## The Rooms Advantage

Most memory layers are single-player. They store facts under a flat user ID and every recall is scoped to one agent's view. This works for personal chatbots but breaks down when:

- **Multiple agents work on the same project**: Agent A can't see Agent B's memories
- **A team shares an AI assistant**: everyone's memories are siloed
- **You want knowledge transfer between agents**: there's no shared space

**Uteke Rooms** create a shared memory layer that sits above individual agent namespaces:

```bash
# Create a shared room
uteke room create "engineering" --description "Team decisions"

# Alice's agent stores a decision
uteke remember "We chose Redis for caching over Memcached" \
  --room engineering --author alice

# Bob's agent adds context
uteke remember "Redis cluster: 3 nodes, 2 replicas each" \
  --room engineering --author bob

# Any agent can recall the shared history
uteke recall "caching decision" --room engineering
```

Every memory in a room carries **author attribution**: you always know who said what. And any agent with access to the room can recall across all entries.

## Decision Tree: Which Archetype Do You Need?

```
Do you have data sovereignty requirements?
├── Yes (healthcare, finance, legal, enterprise)
│   └── Can you run Docker + database services?
│       ├── Yes → Self-Hosted Infrastructure (Archetype 2)
│       └── No  → Single Binary (Archetype 4) → Uteke
│
└── No
    └── Are you building for production or prototyping?
        ├── Prototyping → Python Library (Archetype 3)
        └── Production
            └── Do you want to manage infrastructure?
                ├── Yes → Self-Hosted Infrastructure (Archetype 2)
                └── No
                    └── Is network latency acceptable?
                        ├── Yes → Cloud-Native Platform (Archetype 1)
                        └── No  → Single Binary (Archetype 4) → Uteke
```

## Benchmark: What "Fast" Means

When we say ~45ms recall, we mean it. Here's the breakdown:

| Metric | Result | Context |
|---|---|---|
| **Recall latency (10K memories)** | 42ms P50, 50ms P95 | Flat from 100 to 10K memories (HNSW O(log N)) |
| **Insert throughput** | 6–22 ops/s | CPU-bound (ONNX embedding inference) |
| **Storage per memory** | ~10KB | SQLite + HNSW, scales linearly |
| **LongMemEval Recall@5** | 0.958 | 12-question diverse sample, EmbeddingGemma Q4 |

Compare this to any tool that routes through a network round-trip. Even the fastest cloud API adds 100-300ms of network latency on top of processing time.

**Run your own benchmarks:**

```bash
uteke bench --counts 100,1000,10000 --json
```

## The Bottom Line

There's no "best" memory layer. There's the **right one for your constraints**. The framework above helps you identify those constraints quickly:

| If your priority is... | Choose archetype... |
|---|---|
| **Simplicity** (install in 10 seconds) | Single Binary |
| **Privacy** (data never leaves machine) | Single Binary |
| **Maximum integrations** | Cloud-Native or Self-Hosted |
| **Team infrastructure control** | Self-Hosted |
| **Rapid prototyping** | Python Library |
| **Multi-agent collaboration** | Anything with Rooms |

**Uteke chose simplicity, privacy, and multi-agent collaboration.** If those are your priorities too, give it a try:

```bash
curl -sSL codecora.dev/install | sh
uteke onboard
```

No API keys. No Docker. No Python. Just a memory that works.

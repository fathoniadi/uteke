## Why Local?

uteke runs entirely on your machine. No network calls, no API keys, no data leaving your machine. Your memories — your infrastructure.

**Performance:** ~40-45ms recall is possible because embedding inference, HNSW vector search, and FTS5 all run in-process. No network round-trip.

**Privacy:** Data never leaves your machine. No telemetry. No cloud dependency.

**Simplicity:** Single binary. No Docker Compose, no database server, no Python environment. Just `curl | sh` and go.

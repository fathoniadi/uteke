# Mutation Testing

Uteke uses [cargo-mutants](https://github.com/sourcefrog/cargo-mutants) for mutation testing — a technique that validates **test quality** (not code quality) by modifying source code and checking if existing tests catch the mutation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install cargo-mutants
cargo install cargo-mutants --locked

# Run on a specific file
cargo mutants --file crates/uteke-core/src/salience_recency.rs -j 4 --timeout 60

# Run on all non-excluded files
cd crates/uteke-core && cargo mutants -j 4 --timeout 60
```

## What It Does

cargo-mutants modifies your code automatically:

| Mutation | Example |
|---|---|
| Replace operator | `+` → `*`, `>` → `==`, `*` → `/` |
| Replace constant | `return 0.0` instead of computed value |
| Delete match arm | Remove `"event" =>` from match |
| Flip assignment | `+=` → `-=` |

After each mutation, it runs the test suite. If tests still pass → **missed mutant** (your tests didn't catch the bug).

## When to Run

- **Before releases**: Run on core logic files as a pre-release quality gate
- **After writing new tests**: Verify your tests actually catch bugs
- **CI**: Runs automatically on `develop → main` PRs (see `.github/workflows/mutation-testing.yml`)

## Writing Mutation-Killing Tests

The key insight: **use exact numeric assertions, not just `>` / `<` comparisons**.

### Bad (won't kill mutants)

```rust
// This won't catch replace + with *, because both produce > 0
assert!(salience_score(&m) > 0.0);
```

### Good (kills mutants)

```rust
// This WILL catch replace + with *, because exact value differs
let s = salience_score(&m);  // importance=0.4, access=0, pinned=false
assert!((s - 0.2).abs() < 0.01, "expected ~0.2, got {s}");
//   original: 0.4*0.5 + 0*0.3 + 0 = 0.2
//   mutant:   0.4*0.5 * 0*0.3 + 0 = 0.0  ← caught!
```

### Pattern

1. Pick values where each component of the formula contributes a **distinct, known** amount
2. Compute the expected result by hand
3. Assert with `abs() < epsilon` (floats need tolerance)
4. Add a comment explaining which mutant(s) the test kills

## Excluded Files

See `.cargo/mutants.toml` (workspace root) for the full exclusion list. Files requiring external services (SQLite, embedding API, network) are excluded — mutation testing is most valuable on **pure logic**.

## Current Coverage

| Module | Mutants | Caught | Missed | Equivalent/Timeout | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `jaccard.rs` | 12 | 9 | 0 | 3 (unviable) | 100% |
| `salience_recency.rs` | 53 | 48 | 3 | 2 (eq) | 96% |
| `recall_cache.rs` | 25 | 18 | 5 | ~3 (eq) | 80% |
| `chunker.rs` | 164 | 149 | 0 | 5 (timeout) + 10 (unviable) + 3 (eq, excluded) | 97%* |

*chunker score = 149 caught / (149 + 5 timeouts treated as caught-equivalent) — final verify run, 35m.

**Overall**: 40 new mutation-killing tests added across modules (20 → 60 chunker tests). Chunker mutation score improved from 50% → 97%.

### Production bugs found by mutation testing

Mutation testing on `chunker.rs` exposed **two real production bugs** (now fixed, with regression tests):

1. **Heading duplication in oversized sections** — when a markdown section exceeded `max_chars`, the first sub-chunk contained the heading **twice** (once from `split_by_headings`, once re-prepended by the sub-chunk loop). This corrupted every downstream embedding for such chunks.
2. **Infinite loop on multibyte text with tiny `max_chars`** — `split_long_text`'s progress guard advanced by raw byte offsets that could land inside a multibyte UTF-8 character (e.g. CJK). `chunk_markdown("日本語", 2)` would hang forever.

### Equivalent Mutants

Some mutants produce identical behavior regardless of tests. These are documented as "equivalent mutants" and excluded from scoring (see `exclude_re` in `.cargo/mutants.toml`):

- `apply_boosts: replace > with >=` (2 mutants) — multiplying by weight=0.0 is a no-op
- `recall_cache::put retain: replace < with <=` — get-path TTL check also catches expired entries
- `chunker.rs:282:24 (< → <=)` — `is_char_boundary(text.len())` is always true
- `chunker.rs:425:25 / 443:17 (&& → ||)` — `in_block` and `!current_lines.is_empty()` are always equal (set together)

### Timeout mutants (accepted)

5 chunker mutants cause **infinite loops** (progress guard mutations) — the test binary hangs and cargo-mutants reports TIMEOUT. These are counted as caught-in-spirit: no test can terminate an infinite loop.
